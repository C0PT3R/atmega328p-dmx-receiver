# Atmega328P DMX receiver with PWM outputs
Atmega328P based DMX decoder with PWM outputs. Uses SPI to shift values through SIPO shift registers. Basically a combination of ArDMX and ShiftPWM. Doesn't use the Arduino library, nor its bootloader. Uses a three digits 7-segment display with two buttons to select DMX channel.
